# Airfoil_noise
Regression modelling on NASA Airfoil Self-Noise Dataset

Use the data file airfoil_self_noise.dat. This contains data on the noise generated by an airfoil type under different conditions. 
The task was to estimate the noise as a function of the conditions. (This is an important issue in the design of an aircraft, tbecause a badly designed airfoil will cause large noise impact on the environment.) 

I have tried random forest and adaboost as regression methods.

Description of the dataset:

The NASA data set comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack. The span of the airfoil and the observer position were the same in all of the experiments.

Attribute Information:
This problem has the following inputs:
1. Frequency, in Hertz.
2. Angle of attack, in degrees.
3. Chord length, in meters.
4. Free-stream velocity, in meters per second.
5. Suction side displacement thickness, in meters.
   
The only output is:
7. Scaled sound pressure level, in decibels.
